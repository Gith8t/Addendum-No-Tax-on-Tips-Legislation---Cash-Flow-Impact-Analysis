# Addendum: No Tax on Tips Legislation - Cash Flow Impact Analysis

## Understanding the Proposed Changes

### Current Situation (2024)
- Servers pay income tax on all tips
- Employers pay FICA (7.65%) on reported tips
- Employers withhold employee FICA (7.65%) from paychecks
- Tips count toward minimum wage requirements

### Proposed Changes
- **Federal Level**: No federal income tax on tips
- **FICA Status**: Still unclear if Social Security/Medicare applies
- **State Level**: Varies by state adoption
- **Timeline**: Could be retroactive to 2024 or start 2025

## Cash Flow Impact Analysis

### Immediate Effects IF Implemented

**For Your Servers:**
```
BEFORE (Current Law):
Server Monthly Tips: $3,000
Federal Tax (22%): -$660
State Tax (5%): -$150
FICA (7.65%): -$230
Net to Server: $1,960

AFTER (No Tax on Tips):
Server Monthly Tips: $3,000
Federal Tax: $0
State Tax: TBD by state
FICA: TBD
Net to Server: $2,770-3,000

Impact: Servers keep $810-1,040 more monthly
```

**For Your Restaurant:**
```
POTENTIAL EMPLOYER SAVINGS:
Current employer FICA on tips (7.65%)
20 servers × $3,000/month tips = $60,000
Monthly FICA cost: $4,590
Annual savings if eliminated: $55,080

BUT WATCH OUT FOR:
- Increased minimum wage requirements
- State unemployment tax changes
- Workers comp calculation changes
```

### Cash Flow Warning Areas

**1. Withholding Confusion Period**
```
Risk Period: Implementation to Clarification
What happens:
- Unclear withholding requirements
- Potential over/under withholding
- Year-end corrections needed
- Cash flow unpredictability

Protection Strategy:
- Continue current withholding
- Segregate potential refunds
- Maintain $10K cushion for corrections
```

**2. Minimum Wage Complications**
```
Current: $2.13/hour + tips = $7.25 minimum
If tips become "tax-free income":
- May not count toward minimum wage
- Could owe difference in cash wages
- Example: $5.12/hour additional × 30 servers × 160 hours
- Monthly impact: $24,576 additional payroll
```

**3. State Compliance Nightmare**
```
States May:
- Not adopt federal changes
- Create their own rules
- Change unemployment calculations
- Modify workers comp rates

Multi-State Operations:
- Different rules per location
- Complex payroll processing
- Higher administrative costs
```

## Updated Cash Flow Strategies

### Scenario Planning for 2025

**Best Case Scenario:**
```
- Tips fully tax-free (federal + state)
- Employer FICA eliminated
- Tips still count for minimum wage

Monthly Cash Flow Improvement:
- Employer FICA savings: $4,590
- Reduced turnover costs: $2,000
- Administrative savings: $500
Total: +$7,090/month
```

**Worst Case Scenario:**
```
- Tips tax-free to employees only

- Complex compliance costs

Monthly Cash Flow Impact:
- Minimum wage makeup: -$24,576
- Additional compliance: -$2,000
- System updates: -$500
Total: -$27,076/month
```

**Most Likely Scenario:**
```
- Federal tax eliminated on tips
- FICA remains (employee & employer)
- States vary widely
- 6-month confusion period

Monthly Impact:
- Neutral to employer
- Happy employees = less turnover
- Compliance costs: -$1,000
Net: -$1,000/month during transition
```

### Strategic Opportunities

```
"Work here and keep ALL your tips!"
